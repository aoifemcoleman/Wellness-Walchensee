# Purpose

Walchensee Wonder is a site for a fictitious mountain lodge nestled in the Bavarian Alps, with a focus on wellbeing and mindfulness. The site will be aimed at hikers, travelers and anyone looking for a space to recuperate and disconnect from the business of daily life, in a peaceful and stunning mountain environment.

The main purposes of the site are to advertise the mountain wellness lodge to a wide audience, to provide any potential guests with the details of our packages and what they each include, to convince the user of the benefits of each wellness activity and facility that the lodge provides, and to provide the user with the ability to arrange a reservation.
